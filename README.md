# Parsheela-s-Portfolio
Hi there! I’m Parsheela NG, an aspiring Data Scientist and Web Developer passionate about blending technology with creativity. This portfolio is a reflection of my journey — showcasing my skills, projects, and achievements. It features a clean, modern, and fully responsive design, a dedicated skills and certifications section, an easy-to-use contact form, and fast, lightweight performance. I built this portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, Bootstrap and Flask as frameworks, and Python on the backend. The portfolio is deployed seamlessly on GitHub Pages, making it accessible anytime, anywhere.
